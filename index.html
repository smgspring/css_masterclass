        <span>Rodić Davidson: London Architecture</span>
        <p>
          Our Bloomsbury based practice has been working in central London since
          2006. Having worked within the oldest areas of London, we have
          developed an expertise in historic buildings. These are often Listed
          and situated within a Conservation Area. Our knowledge and experience
          consistently secure Planning Consents, Listed Building Consents and
          Great Estate Licenses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many areas within central London boroughs were originally developed by
          aristocratic families (examples being Grosvenor, Cadogan, De Walden,
          Portman and Bedford), and these family estates still own large swathes
          of, what is now commonly referred to as, Prime Central London. These
          Great Estates maintain significant influence either through direct
          ownership or through various stewardship schemes, an example being the
          Belgrave Estate Management Scheme administered by Grosvenor. Schemes
          such as this enable the Estate to exert control over the use,
          development, and appearance of the designated area.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have a growing body of new-build work in Prime Central London and
          elsewhere in the UK. Through sensitive, contextual design and
          iterative dialogue with Clients and Planners, Rodić Davidson have
          established a track record of obtaining difficult planning consents
          for both new-build and existing properties.
